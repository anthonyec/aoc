## Setup
1. Install Godot 4.2
2. Add this project
3. Run the main scene!

Currently I just set the main scene's script to whatever challenge I want to run. For example, if I want to run `day_02.gd`, then I drag that script to the `Main` node.

I'll make it more fancy later. Maybe with some snow particles or something.
