# Challenge - Day 1

## Part 1

On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit 
and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, 
and 77. Adding these together produces 142. Consider your entire calibration 
document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

## Part 2

Some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, 
four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

For example:

```
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. 
Adding these together produces 281. What is the sum of all of the 
calibration values?
